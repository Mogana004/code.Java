# Running a Java program written in Notepad and executing it in the Command Prompt involves several steps. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:

 ## 1) Write Java Code in Notepad:
Start by writing your Java code in a text editor like Notepad. Save the file with a .java extension. This file will contain the source code of your Java program.

## 2) Compile Java Code:
Open the Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory where your Java file is located. You can use the cd command to change directories. Once you're in the correct directory, use the javac command to compile your Java code. For example:


### Copy code
cd path\to\your\java\file
javac YourProgram.java


This step converts your human-readable Java code into bytecode, which is a set of instructions that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand.

# Execute Java Program:
After successfully compiling your Java code, you can run it using the java command followed by the name of the class containing the main method. The name of the class should be the same as the name of your .java file (without the .java extension). For example:

### Copy code
java YourProgram
The JVM loads the bytecode generated by the compiler and executes it.

Output:
If your Java program produces any output (e.g., printing to the console), you'll see it in the Command Prompt window.

 # Program Execution:
Your Java program runs according to the logic you've written. It can interact with the user, read input, perform calculations, and produce output as specified in the code.

# Termination:
Once the program finishes executing or encounters a return statement in the main method, it terminates, and control returns to the Command Prompt.

In summary, the process involves writing Java code in Notepad, compiling it using the javac command in the Command Prompt to generate bytecode, and then executing the bytecode using the java command.
The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the Java program, producing any specified output.
